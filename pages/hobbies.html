            <h1>What I Like!</h1>

            <h3>Technical stuff</h3>
            <p>I love writing software, especially code that "does things".
                I LOVE C. It is my favorite language, and became so after my Compilers course.
                I have tried to write as many programs for class in C, albeit time constraints led me to switch to Python for many.
                My first language was RobotC in High School, and futher C++ during my introduction courses at Clarkson.
            </p>
            <p>As a result of this, I have a yearning desire to work with embedded systems.
                Unfortunately, I don't have any current project ideas for working with them, and also lack the funds to purchase a development board.
                As an Electrical Engineer, I took a course in embedded systems and was instantly hooked.
                After my current software projects (and after finding a job), I plan to purchase a development board and do some projects with it.
            </p>
            <p>I also quite enjoy web development. It allows me to express a creative side I don't typically use very often.
                For this website in particular, I very much enjoyed creating the layout of my site, as well as making some small art for it.
                At my under construction page, I created the Isaac sketching on a piece of paper myself (inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/QVNXsMlWuLU?si=ib-afK0N3_OMoc0B&t=2">this</a> scene of The Binding of Isaac
                Also, I made the favicon for my website as a little cyndaquil (since my site is named cyndquil, after cyndaquil).
            </p>
            <p>I also LOVE Linux. I run Arch (btw) on my main development laptop and have been in love with it since I began using it.
                I run xmonad as a window manager, and use Neovim (btw) with tmux as my primary development toolkit.
                I still am quite new to it all, though.
                I have only been using this setup for about a year, and only recently began updating my configuration and packages to be more "modern".
                Using Neovim, I learned a lot about Lua, and xmonad has taught me much more about Haskell (although I had already previously taken a course using Haskell).
                More information can be found at the bottom of my <a href="https://cyndquil.com/projects.html">Projects</a> tab.
            </p>

            <h3>Math! (+ Teaching)</h3>
            <p>I love to learn about Math.
                Ever since taking BC Calculus in High School, I knew math was a topic I would love to study in college.
                My primary interests are in Abstract Algebra, Topology, Linear Algebra, and High School level (teaching) math.
                I almost became a teacher, however changed career paths because of financial concerns with the occupation (and I would need to take another year to get my MAT and be certified).
            </p>
            <p>Now that I'm out of college, I would love to read more textbooks on abstract mathematics.
                In particular, learning about theoretical physics from the viewpoint of abstract math sounds fascinating to me.
                If you have any suggestions on texts to read regarding this, or any of the topics I listed above, feel free to leave me suggestions!
            </p>
            <p>In my free time I plan to (attempt) to self-study math with friends and also teach some people close to me more about both Math and CS topics who are less informed on higher-level stuff.
                I don't really have a plan for this, but have thought of some ways to go about this.
                In particular, I love writing TeX documents, and have thought about creating TeX files either describing Math there, or creating worksheets
                for them to work on.
                In the future, I do have a long-term plan of leaving the industry and becoming either a High School Math or Computer Science Teacher.
                I would also love to get my PhD in Abstract Mathematics (for no other reason than because I LOVE Math).
            </p>

            <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <p>My favorite video games include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Legend of Zelda (series), Majora's Mask is my favorite game ever
                <li>The Binding of Isaac
                <li>Dark Souls (1, 2)
                <li>Hollow Knight
                <li>Metroid (series)
                <li>Pokemon Legends: Arceus
                <li>Five Nights at Freddy's 2
                <li>+ More I'm definitely forgetting
            </ul>
            <p>Many of my days recently have been spent playing The Binding of Isaac: Repentance in hopes of achieving Dead God.
                I'm always open to chat about video games, and open to suggestions for what to play next as well!
            </p>
