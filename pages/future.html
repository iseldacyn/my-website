            <h1>What's to come?</h1>
            <p>Firstly: a job! I hope to find something soon, probably as a web developer because of my experience recently working with web applications.
                Next, I will definitely finish my blog site and begin working on Recipe Buddy using the information I gained from my blog.
            </p>
            <p>I am unsure about frameworks currently. I think I will create my blog either without a framework, or something simple like PHP.
                I then think I will try to create Recipe Buddy using Ruby on Rails (since it is highly scalable).
                I might also consider using a front-end framework such as React.JS to get more experience under my belt in front-end design (and because CSS takes a lot of time to make perfect).
            </p>
            <p>During this I will probably play video games more and work on my Linux Distribution.
                I currently really want Dead God in Isaac, and have been spending too much time playing that instead of being productive on my website.
                Additionally, there are some bugs in my Neovim config I wish to address, and do more research on LSPs and using VimTeX with Treesitter (or disabling VimTeX altogether).
            </p>
            <p>Afterwords, I have some project ideas I would love to get started on. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working on re-implementing the 2048 AI to be written in C and also visualize it using Processing (maybe OpenGL instead?)
                <li>Updating my CS452 project to have proper lighting and effects
                <li>Buy a development board and create projects using an embedded system (probably STM32)
                <li>With above, initialize that development board using custom-written boilerplate code, rather than preconfigured code
                <li>Make a video game! Still unsure if I want to use a game engine, or create my own engine (maybe both?)
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, I wish to learn some new programming languages and create projects with them.
                Languages I want to use are Zig, Go, Rust, Typescript, and Ruby.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, getting my PhD in Mathematics or MAT/certification to teach Math/Computer Science in High School is a current long-term career goal.
                I love teaching and math, and really want to study more math and teach it to those who may not understand it well.
                I wish to be a teacher students look up to, and want to help them understand something they may not be comfortable with otherwise!
                In the wise words of Chef Gusteau from Ratatouille, "Anyone can [learn mathematics]."
            </p>
            <p>I have many passions and a lot I want to accomplish but feel I won't have enough time in my life to get it all done.
                I will certainly try my best to finish these all, though, and will try my best to have fun in the mean time!
            </p>
